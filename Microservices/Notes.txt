MicroServices: 

Monolith Application : Different Components like

-Presentation -  responsible for handling Http requests, and response
- Business Logic - the application logic
- Data Layer  - data ccess objects for acessing the data from any datasource
- Application Integration - integrate with other services

While deploying, all the above logical modules are packaged into one monolith. 

Benefits of Monolith :
 - Simple to Develop
 - Simple to Test (we can perform end-to-end testing with some tools like selenium etc.)
 - Simple to deploy (copy the packaged application to a server)
 - Scaling horizontally is very simple and easy 

DrawBacks of Monolith :
- Limitation in terms of size and complexity
- Understanding and making changes is tough
- More complex the application, start up time can slow down
- For every change, there is a need to re deploy the entire application
- Continuous deployment is difficult
- Different modules can have conflicting resource requirements, making it difficult to scale
- adopting to new technologies/frameworks/languages is difficult since it effects the entire application

Microservices : is about splitting the large,complex systems vertically based on functionality or business requirements into smaller sub-systems.

- The sub systems communicates with each other via networks calls, messaging, REST services etc.
