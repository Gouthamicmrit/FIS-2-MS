MicroServices: 

Monolith Application : Different Components like

-Presentation -  responsible for handling Http requests, and response
- Business Logic - the application logic
- Data Layer  - data ccess objects for acessing the data from any datasource
- Application Integration - integrate with other services

While deploying, all the above logical modules are packaged into one monolith. 

Benefits of Monolith :
 - Simple to Develop
 - Simple to Test (we can perform end-to-end testing with some tools like selenium etc.)
 - Simple to deploy (copy the packaged application to a server)
 - Scaling horizontally is very simple and easy 

DrawBacks of Monolith :
- Limitation in terms of size and complexity
- Understanding and making changes is tough
- More complex the application, start up time can slow down
- For every change, there is a need to re deploy the entire application
- Continuous deployment is difficult
- Different modules can have conflicting resource requirements, making it difficult to scale
- adopting to new technologies/frameworks/languages is difficult since it effects the entire application

Microservices : is about splitting the large,complex systems vertically based on functionality or business requirements into smaller sub-systems.

- The sub systems communicates with each other via networks calls, messaging, REST services etc.
- Can take advantage of technology and resources as per the requirement of each sub system
- Each service can use a type of database that suits best to its needs - PolyGlot Persistence

NFR : non Functional Requirements

Benifits of Microservices
1. Decomposing complexity into set of manageable services that can be developed faster, and easier
2. Understanding one service, maintaining, and fixing
3. A focused team can be deployed to work on one service
4. Developers are free to choose technologies 
5. Individual services can be re-deployed
6. Possibility of Continuous deployemnet
7. Enables each service to be scaled independently

Drawback:

1. Multiple updates to multiple database owned by different services because of partitioned database
2. Testing Microservices is more complex - Similar test for a service requires to launch that service and any other service that it depends on
3. Implementing changes that span multiple services requires careful planning and rollout of each service meticulously
4. Configuring each service instance, deploying, scaling and monitoring is a challenge
5. Implement service discovery mechanisms and requires high level of automation

When to use Microservices :

1. Enterprise Application development when multiple teams work on the application
2. Web-Scale Development
3. Long term goals/gains 
4. Skilled Software architects(sr. engg., designers, microservice Architect


Microservices vs. ApI

It's an architecural style that structures applications as a collection of small autonomous services built around a business domain. Each being a self-contained service implementing a single business capability
- are components
- some can be used to expose one or more API
-small in size
- can be built quickly

API : Is an Appl. prog. interface through which, we can ensure two or more applln.s communicate with each other to hadnle client request
- are interfaces
- ApI is one of the means to build and expose microservices architecture
-large in size
-take longer time to build
